    "Health is something that defines you, without uttering a word. A healthy person looks smart and fresh. Being healthy is a state of body where we feel energetic, have proper sleep, proper diet, and etc. If you are healthy you will automatically be fit. Health and fitness are two terms, where health is something that deals with all social, mental, and physical state of body and mind; whereas fitness defines your body. But both are interlinked to each other. A healthy person is someone who does not have any kind of health issues, has proper body structure and is mentally happy. But a fit person is someone who can do things in a better way and are also conscious about their health.",
